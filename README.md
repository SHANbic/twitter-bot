# twitter-bot

Really nice project here, where I was able to handle some simple things related to my twitter account.
If you ever need to use these little pieces of code, you'll first want to install tweepy by running a command line:
```terminal
pip3 install tweepy
```

No specifi python commands for this program, you'll have to go through the code and uncomment the functions you want to use. Pretty bad news, you'll also have to go through the twitter api doc so to request an account (about 5 minutes) and get your api tokens.

I commented the code so that you easily know which parts to uncomment to make use of a function and have an idea of how all of this works.  You'll able to like tweets based on keywords or add some of your followers to your friends :)

All you will need to do is to run the program by typing:
```terminal
python3 twitter_bot.py
```
